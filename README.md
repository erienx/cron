# Cron-like Program with Logging System

## Overview

This project is a **cron-like program**, similar to the cron service in Unix systems. It is made to schedule and manage tasks to run at specific times. It is a **client-server model** and has a logging system which logs the execution and the program's state. Log level of detail can be manipulated by sending signals to the program.

## Dependencies
- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compliant system
  
## Set up and usage
Start with downloading the project on a Linux based system.


* Although the program follows a client-server model, only one executable file is required for both server and client operations. Said file will be generated by entering 
```
make
```
in its directory.


* When server is not running:
```
./main
```
should be called and the server will start.

* Once the server is running all the calls starting with **./main** will require additional arguments as the client's code will be used. Legal commands are the following:
```
./main -m <absolute/relative/cyclic> -t <exact time/in how many seconds/every how many seconds to execute> -p <path to executable>
./main -l
./main -c <index>
```

* Sample <path to executable> is given **test_program**. It will likely not have executable permission, thus it should be given with:
```
chmod +x test_program
```

* Additionally, logging functionality can be controlled and expanded by sending signals. Lets begin with compiling the singal sender program using:
```
gcc -o sig execute_signal.c
```

it can be ran with:
```
./execute_signal <pid> <signal> 100
```

where: 
1. <pid> is the server's ID which is displayed when the server is ran
2. <signal> is value of a signal, in this program **{34,35,36}** are useable
3. last argument does not apply

- signal 34 dumps the current state log file
- singal 35 toggles logging on and off
- signal 36 changes log level of detail
